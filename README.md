# Tomato Leaf Disease Image Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify tomato leaf images into disease categories. It processes labeled images, applies data augmentation, and trains a deep learning model capable of recognizing different tomato leaf diseases from images.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository provides:

- A complete image classification pipeline.
- Preprocessing steps to load, resize, and normalize images.
- Data augmentation to improve generalization.
- A configurable CNN model architecture.
- Training and validation with performance tracking.

The model outputs a probability distribution across all disease classes, enabling precise identification of plant health issues.
